to get crow to work on mac:

https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/issues/881
using boost 1.60
    problems 1.70+


trying to run new c++ project with crow sitting in main dir.  doesn't work:
fatal error: 'boost/optional.hpp' file not found ?

so we have to write new code from within crow project .... 
.... that'll be fine until the next external library we need to use ...
... just use "helloworld" in crow.  idk how to make new c++ file... makefiles etc ???


try these next?
