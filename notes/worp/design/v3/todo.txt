sept 13 2020 -

just get v2 working. dont worry about anything else.

--------------------------------------------
dont learn packer. dont deal w/ aws.  get everything working locally.

start chaperone, oracle, and library manager locally

so, simulate a Nest, Delphi, and Library -- locally


but -- use ddb!  so that means .... deploy ddb w/ code. using... sls?



use python service in separate server to start ec2s

wait a second.... maybe some species dont have to be in rust ....

use typescript and packer
only use rust when it's necessary (ferrets and librarians).  well it's not necessary for librarians, but the indexing/rocksdb code is already written in rust.  also use for oracle for speed.



WORKERS:

ferret, librarian, oracle: rust

MANAGERS:

so chaperone, librarymanager, overmind: use typescript


use lambdas for overmind!  so use serverlessframework isntead of terraform.


- put worpdrive back in worp-rust ... stupid to lose all those commits/messages
- rename to squirrel, ferret, owl.
- overmind --> lion?  beaver (cos architect)?
